      // To anyone reading this (respected teacher or fellow student), the 10-line/statement rule was not respected in many sections of this project.

      // and obfuscating the code beyond the point of oblivion. Note that where possible, we indeed tried to decompose, just not necessarily down to 10 lines.
      // We hope this design decision on our part isn't too much of a problem and wish you a pleasant reading.
